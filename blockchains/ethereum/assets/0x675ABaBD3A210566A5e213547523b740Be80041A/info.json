    "description": "The Entropy Network aims to provide a high-performance and customized blockchain mainnet that can serve decentralized applications (dapps) in an optimized and efficient environment. The current limitations of existing blockchain networks, such as slow transaction processing, high fees, and volatility during upgrades, have created a demand for more autonomous mainnets that can be easily expanded.",
